# Security Considerations - MCP CTF Challenge Server

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER

This server contains **INTENTIONAL SECURITY VULNERABILITIES** designed for educational purposes. It should **NEVER** be used in production environments or with real sensitive data.

## 🎯 Intentional Vulnerabilities

### Easy Challenges
1. **Basic Prompt Injection** - Weak input validation allows direct prompt manipulation
2. **Tool Description Poisoning** - Hidden malicious instructions in tool metadata
3. **Excessive File Access** - Missing path validation enables file system traversal
4. **Token Exposure** - Hardcoded secrets exposed in configuration responses

### Medium Challenges
1. **Indirect Prompt Injection** - Unsanitized external data processing
2. **Tool Shadowing** - Dynamic tool registration without proper validation
3. **Privilege Escalation** - Multiple chained vulnerabilities in access controls

## 🛡️ Deployment Security

### Recommended Safeguards

1. **Isolated Environment**
   ```yaml
   # Use containerized deployment
   # Limit network access
   # Separate from production systems
   ```

2. **Resource Limits**
   ```yaml
   # CPU: 1 core max
   # Memory: 512MB max
   # Disk: 1GB max
   # Network: Rate limited
   ```

3. **Access Control**
   ```yaml
   # Restrict to authorized participants
   # Monitor access logs
   # Implement basic rate limiting
   ```

### Render Platform Security

```yaml
Environment Variables:
  RENDER: "true"
  PORT: "8000"
  # No sensitive data in environment

Resource Limits:
  - Free tier automatically limits resources
  - Automatic scaling disabled
  - Limited concurrent connections

Network Security:
  - HTTPS enforced by Render
  - No direct database connections
  - Isolated container environment
```

## 🚨 Risk Assessment

### High Risk (Intentional)
- **Arbitrary Code Execution**: File access challenges allow reading system files
- **Information Disclosure**: Multiple challenges expose sensitive data
- **Authentication Bypass**: Privilege escalation challenges bypass access controls

### Medium Risk (Mitigated)
- **Denial of Service**: Limited by Render platform constraints
- **Data Persistence**: No database, limited file system access
- **Network Access**: Containerized environment limits external connections

### Low Risk (Acceptable)
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Platform limits prevent significant impact
- **Cross-User Contamination**: Stateless design minimizes persistence

## 🔒 Security Controls

### Platform-Level Controls
```yaml
Render Platform:
  - Container isolation
  - Resource limits
  - Network restrictions
  - HTTPS termination
  - Automatic security updates

Docker Container:
  - Non-root user execution
  - Minimal base image
  - No privileged access
  - Limited file system access
```

### Application-Level Controls
```yaml
Intentionally Weak:
  - Input validation (educational vulnerabilities)
  - Access controls (demonstration purposes)
  - Data sanitization (learning objectives)

Maintained:
  - No real sensitive data
  - No external system access
  - No persistent data storage
  - Limited system interaction
```

## 📋 Security Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] Review all intentional vulnerabilities
- [ ] Confirm no real sensitive data
- [ ] Verify isolated deployment environment
- [ ] Test resource limits
- [ ] Document all vulnerabilities

### During CTF Event
- [ ] Monitor resource usage
- [ ] Watch for unintended exploitation
- [ ] Log all access attempts
- [ ] Maintain participant communication
- [ ] Have rollback plan ready

### Post-Event
- [ ] Review access logs
- [ ] Document any issues
- [ ] Clean up deployment
- [ ] Archive learning materials
- [ ] Conduct security review

## 🎓 Educational Value vs Risk

### Benefits
- **Hands-on Learning**: Real vulnerability exploitation
- **Safe Environment**: Controlled, isolated system
- **Practical Skills**: Applicable security knowledge
- **Ethical Hacking**: Responsible disclosure practices

### Risks Mitigated
- **No Production Impact**: Isolated test environment
- **No Real Data**: All secrets are fake/educational
- **Limited Scope**: Container and platform restrictions
- **Supervised Use**: CTF event context with guidance

## 🚫 Prohibited Uses

### DO NOT:
- Deploy in production environments
- Use with real sensitive data
- Connect to production systems
- Use techniques on unauthorized systems
- Share exploitation techniques maliciously

### DO:
- Use for educational purposes only
- Practice responsible disclosure
- Report unintended vulnerabilities
- Follow ethical hacking guidelines
- Respect platform terms of service

## 📞 Incident Response

### If Unintended Vulnerability Found:
1. **Document** the vulnerability
2. **Report** to CTF organizers immediately
3. **Do not exploit** beyond demonstration
4. **Assist** in remediation if requested

### If System Compromised:
1. **Isolate** the deployment
2. **Review** access logs
3. **Assess** impact scope
4. **Remediate** vulnerabilities
5. **Document** lessons learned

## 🔍 Monitoring Recommendations

### Metrics to Track:
- Request volume and patterns
- Resource utilization
- Error rates and types
- Response times
- Unusual access patterns

### Alerting Thresholds:
- CPU usage > 80%
- Memory usage > 90%
- Error rate > 10%
- Unusual request patterns
- Extended response times
